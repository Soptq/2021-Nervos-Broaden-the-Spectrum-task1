Task1: Create A Godwoken Account On The EVM Layer 2 Testnet

Submitter: Soptq

## A screenshot of the accounts you created (account list) in ckb-cli

## A link to the Layer 1 address you funded on the Testnet Explorer

It is in the `faucet-link` file:

```

Due to my network problem, the transaction cannot be verified by the deposite script (connection timeout). However, the blockchain explorer suggests that the deposite is **successful**.
